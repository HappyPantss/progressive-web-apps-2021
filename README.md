# ‚ú® Functionalities
## Routing
When visiting the site, you will be redirected to `/overview`, this is the homepage. When choosing a hero for checking there details, you go to `/heroes/:name`. You can change the name of the hero to go to their detail page.
## Service Worker
The Service Worker saves the files you need for the specific page that you're on in the cache. Not only the .js and .css files are saved, but also the routes. This wil make sure the files will be available when offline. The files are saved in the cache when you're online, and are being served when offline. When a page isn't found, you're going to a offline page.
# ‚ö°Ô∏è Optimising
## Minifying CSS
One of the things I've done to optimise my site, is minifying my CSS. To make this work, I used the npm package Gulp. To see the results of implementing this, see [Tests](#-tests).
## Images
### Making images static
A big issue, is that I have alot of images. For reasons of ease, I used links for the images. And I thought this would help for optimising reasons. But I wanted to compress the images for beter performance. So I downloaded all images, and set them in my project.
### Tinypng
One big fix would be compressing my images. Some of them were already not that big, but it always helps to compress them. So I compressed all of my images with the tool [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/). Compressing with tinypng makes sure the size of the images drops, but the quality stays.
# üìù Critical Render Path
## First View
The time your spending waiting until you see all the elements for the first time.
## Repeat View
The time your spending waiting until you see all the elements after the first time.
## Perceived performance
How quickly a page can load and render all of its visual elements to the screen.
## Time To Interaction
Time to interactive is the amount of time it takes for the page to become fully interactive.
## Time To First Byte
Time To First Byte is the amount of time spent waiting for the initial response. The time you have to wait for the response going from the client to the server, and back.
